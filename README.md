## Linear Regression Model
### Prediction using supervisd learning
This code is written in Python 3 language on a Jupyter Notebook. The goal of this code is to read dataseet of only two columns which are number ofhours studied by student and score percentage he gets. The model should predict the score of student based on the no. of study hours (ex: 9.25 hours --> 93.69%). This is implemented by Scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas and numpy libraries with linear regression model shown on a straight line. The data given were split into training and testing data to avoid overfitting of results using sklearn library. Then test data were used to predict the scores of students.
